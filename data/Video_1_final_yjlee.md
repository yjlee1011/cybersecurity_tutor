# What is Cyber-security?

What is Cyber-security?
Cyber and then security. It simply means protecting our computer system like computer, laptop, iPad, all we call as a system of computer and the network that connects that computer with Internet along the data like whatever we are doing that information that smallest unit we call data that are important to us, protecting them from theft, damage, or unauthorized access that we call the cybersecurity. They safeguard that information. So, cybersecurity means safeguarding our cyber information.

# What are the goals of cybersecurity?

What are the goals of cybersecurity?
The goal is information assurance. So just think about it. So, a security personnel is guarding an asset or valuable information. But whenever we need, we need to get the information for our use. That is called information assurance.

# How is information assurance achieved?

How is information assurance achieved?
Information assurance can be done with the three important points like confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Simply this is termed as CIA.

## What is confidentiality?

What is confidentiality?
Confidentiality means the information is kept very secret, private and secure. And only authorized personnel can access it.

## What is Integrity?

What is Integrity?
When the information is confidential, it should be accurate, reliable, and consistent. That's when it is said to have integrity.

## What is Availability?

What is Availability?
When a person is authorized and he can get the accurate information, then availability is to serve that information to him in the right way. That's called the system and data must be available.

# What is cyber-attack?

What is cyber-attack?
It is an attempt to steal data or cause harm to a computer, network or device.

# What is a cyber threat?

What is a cyber threat?
Cyber threats mean an attack or piece of malware that desire or can cause harm to the target. Threat means an attacker put something which could be a software or some malicious things that hinder your Internet access or whatever you are doing.

# What is cyber Vulnerability?

What is cyber Vulnerability?
Vulnerability means the system or enivironment may have some fault that the attacker can use and cause harm to the entire system or environment.

# What is Cyber Exploit and cyber-risk?

What is Cyber Exploit and cyber-risk?
Cyber exploit means there may be some method by which an attacker can come to the weak door or weak points into the system or the environment. It poses always more risk to your information. That's called a cyber risk. So we can apply some probability, the chances of occurrence of that threats or the vulnerability or exploit that we can do with some calculation called a cyber risk.

# What is Denial-of-service attack (DOS attack)?

What is Denial-of-service attack (DOS attack)?
Information extortion can be blackmailing, or it can be software related attack. It could be virus, worm or any other software virus. There is one term here called denial of service. This is also a cyber-attack. A DOS (Denial of Service) attack is like someone jamming the door of a store, making it impossible for others to enter and do their shopping. In the digital world, it's when a flood of fake or overwhelming requests is sent to a website or server, making it so busy that it can't serve legitimate users, causing it to crash or become inaccessible.

# Classification of threats with examples.

Classification of threats with examples.
Threats categories and examples are as below:
1. Compromises to intellectual properties - Piracy and copyright infringement
2. Deviations in quality of service - Internet service provider (ISP) or WAN service problems or Power
3. Espionage or trespass - Unauthorised access or data collection
4. Forces of nature - Fire, Floods, Lightning or Earthquakes
5. Human error or failure - Accidents or Employee Mistakes
6. Information extortion - Blackmail or information disclosure
7. Sabotage or vandalism - Destruction of systems or Information
8. Software attacks - Viruses, worms, Macros, denial of service
9. Hardware failures - Equipment failure
10. Software failures - Bugs, code problems or unknown loopholes
11. Technological obsolescence - Antiquated or outdated technologies
12. Thefts - Illegal confiscation of equipment or information

# What are the examples of cyber-attacks?

What are the examples of cyber-attacks?
When it is a software attack, this is a cyber threat category. But whenever I say the example of software attack, that goes with the attack like cyber-attack. So here Malware, worms and denial of service. These are example of cyber-attack. And then it goes, you know, in the category of cyber threat in a software attack. So, attack and threats, these are very closely connected. So, threats are very generic term and attacks are more specific.

# What is the probability of occurrence of attack. And what could be the impact? 

What is the probability of occurrence of attack. And what could be the impact? 
There is a probability and statistics that you can apply there, and we can make a matrix like that. You see the heat map in a COVID time, red and different colours. Different colour shows that the intensity of the threat. Red here means dangerous. If it is green, it's safe. But here it's less. So, it's greenish. So anyway, so this way we can just make a heat map, simply call is a risk matrix. And, you know, to show the risk of cyber incidents may happen in any organization. So, we can also go by that four different terminology that used in cybersecurity. These are used more often. Simply you can say IAAA.

# What is IAAA?

What is IAAA?
Identification, authentication, authorization and accountability. So very first thing is identification and then authentication. So identification and authentication. These two words together means if you identify a person, then he's authenticated to do the particular tasks. Identification simply means providing Identity to the system.

Then we need to authenticate that he or she is a genuine individual.In short the user's identity is verified. 

Authorization, the third point, is determining whether the user is allowed access to the resources or services. That is authorization. 

So, fourth point is accountability. It holds user responsible for their action on the system. That is called the accountability because insider threats are more common to take place leading to cyber-attacks. Individuals may intentionally or unintentionally open up towards the vulnerabilities that can cause a cyber attack.

# How can we ensure accountability in the system?

How can we ensure accountability in the system?
User log in organizations are recorded so that they can find out that who is accountable for doing particular task that is harming or giving some potential threat for some other things. In other words it is called accountability. 

# What is Malware?

What is Malware?
Malware is like a sneaky digital bug that infects your device without permission. It can cause all sorts of trouble, like stealing your information, messing up your files, or even taking control of your computer.

## What are the different types of malwares?

What are the different types of malwares?
So, there are different types of malwares. It could be virus, worm as we talked about software. You see, there are many ways that can harm our computer or the entire computer network. Even the keylogger sometimes we install for one good purpose, but it serves the purpose of taking and stealing all our information.

# How can we protect our information?

How can we protect our information?
We install antivirus to which we need a subscription. Free version always comes with terms and conditions expiration date.

Hence we need to know more to secure our computer networks. Just setting up an antivirus will not completely secure our devices/networks from hacking. You can safeguard your information with the lock and key. Hacking refers to unauthorized access, manipulation, exploitation and computer system network, like simply stealing your information for a lot of different reasons.

The main motto of hacking is to steal your private information in an illegal way. But as a indivduals using technology, we need to know the ways to protect ourselves from getting hacked. There are many, many algorithms, many methods they can be used. One most interesting and important method they use called social engineering.

# What is Social Engineering?

What is Social Engineering?
Social engineering in cybersecurity is like a digital con game. Instead of using fancy hacking tools, cybercriminals use tricks and manipulation to deceive people into giving away sensitive information or doing something they shouldn't, like clicking on a harmful link or sharing their passwords. It's all about exploiting human trust rather than technical vulnerabilities. So social engineering method includes phishing, spear phishing, vishing and smishing.

## What is Phishing?

What is Phishing?
Phishing means a fraud attempt that is prepared by random attacker against a wide number of users. That's called phishing. Phishing attempt to manipulate people into giving important information over phone or emails.

### How can Phishing be identified?

How can Phishing be identified?
Suppose you receive an anonymous email with a link describing it as a way to get the money or lottery perhaps somethime showing that you own it. It is quite simple to identify it first being the email address. If you see that email address, you check that domain, whether it's coming from the trusted domain or trusted sender because no organisation will give anyone anything for free just like that. It is always better to verify the genuinity of the email that the individual recieved.

If the email is recieved looks like a scam, immediately report the email to the concerned authorities in that particular organisation without trying to access any attachments or the links that are given in the email.

## What is Smishing? 

What is Smishing? 
Smishing is like phishing, but it happens through text messages on your phone instead of emails. Scammers send fake texts that look like they're from legitimate sources, like your bank or a delivery service. They try to trick you into clicking on links or giving away personal information, just like in email phishing. So, in simple terms, smishing is phishing through text messages.

## What is spear phishing?

What is spear phishing?
Spear phishing is a targeted form of phishing where cybercriminals customize their attacks for specific individuals or organizations. Instead of casting a wide net, like traditional phishing, spear phishing involves researching and tailoring messages to trick a particular person or group into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or financial data


## What is Vishing?

What is Vishing?
Vishing is a type of scam where cybercriminals use phone calls (voice + phishing = vishing) to trick people into giving away personal information or money. They might pretend to be from a bank, government agency, or tech support, and try to scare or manipulate you into revealing sensitive details like passwords or credit card numbers.
