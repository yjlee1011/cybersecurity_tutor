What is Cyber-security?,"Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. It involves implementing measures to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and other cyber threats."
What are the goals of cybersecurity?,"The goals of cybersecurity include protecting information and systems from unauthorized access, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data, detecting and responding to security incidents, and implementing measures to prevent cyber threats and attacks."
How is information assurance achieved?,"Information assurance is achieved through ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. This is often referred to as the CIA triad in information security. Confidentiality ensures that information is only accessed by authorized individuals, integrity ensures that information is accurate and reliable, and availability ensures that information is accessible when needed. By implementing measures to protect these three aspects, information assurance can be achieved."
What is confidentiality?,"Confidentiality means the information is kept very secret, private, and secure, and only authorized personnel can access it."
What is Integrity?,"In the context of information assurance, integrity refers to the quality of information being accurate, reliable, and consistent while maintaining confidentiality. It ensures that the information has not been altered or tampered with in an unauthorized manner."
What is Availability?,Availability in the context of information assurance refers to ensuring that authorized individuals have access to accurate information when they need it. It involves making sure that systems and data are available and accessible to those who are authorized to use them.
What is cyber-attack?,"A cyber-attack refers to an intentional malicious action that targets computer systems, networks, or devices, with the goal of causing damage, stealing data, or disrupting normal operations. It can involve various methods such as malware, phishing, denial of service attacks, or other tactics aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities in digital systems."
What is a cyber threat?,A cyber threat is an attack or a piece of malware that is designed to cause harm to a target. It can be in the form of software or other malicious elements that disrupt your Internet access or activities.
What is cyber Vulnerability?,"Cyber vulnerability refers to weaknesses or gaps in a system's security that can be exploited by attackers to compromise the system or gain unauthorized access to data. These vulnerabilities can include software bugs, misconfigurations, outdated software, weak passwords, and other factors that can be targeted by cyber attackers to carry out a cyber attack."
What is Cyber Exploit and cyber-risk?,"Cyber exploit refers to a method by which an attacker can exploit weak points in a system or environment, posing a risk to information security. Cyber risk is the probability of threats, vulnerabilities, or exploits occurring, calculated through risk assessment methods."
What is Denial-of-service attack (DOS attack)?,"A DOS (Denial of Service) attack is like someone jamming the door of a store, making it impossible for others to enter and do their shopping. In the digital world, it's when a flood of fake or overwhelming requests is sent to a website or server, making it so busy that it can't serve legitimate users, causing it to crash or become inaccessible."
How can cybersecurity threats be classified?,"Cybersecurity threats can be classified into various categories such as malware, phishing, ransomware, DDoS attacks, insider threats, and more. Each category represents a different type of threat that can target systems, networks, or individuals in different ways."
What are the examples of cyber-attacks?,"Some examples of cyber-attacks include malware infections, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, ransomware attacks, and man-in-the-middle attacks."
What is the probability of occurrence of attack. And what could be the impact?,"The probability of a cyber-attack occurring can vary depending on the specific circumstances and the security measures in place. The impact of a cyber-attack can also vary widely, ranging from financial losses, data breaches, reputational damage, operational disruptions, to legal consequences. It is essential for organizations to assess and address vulnerabilities to reduce the likelihood of a cyber-attack and mitigate its potential impact."
What is IAAA?,"IAAA stands for Identification, Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting. It is a framework used in cybersecurity to ensure secure access to systems and data. 

- **Identification**: Verifying the identity of users or entities accessing the system.
- **Authentication**: Confirming the identity of users or entities through credentials like passwords, biometrics, etc.
- **Authorization**: Granting appropriate access rights and permissions to authenticated users or entities.
- **Accounting**: Tracking and logging the activities of users or entities for auditing and monitoring purposes.

A heat map is a graphical representation of data where values are depicted by colors. In the context of cybersecurity, a heat map can be used to visualize and analyze security-related data, such as the frequency of security incidents, the distribution of access rights, or the severity of threats across different areas of a system or network."
How can we ensure accountability in the system?,"Accountability in a system can be ensured by implementing measures such as access controls, audit trails, regular monitoring, and enforcing strict policies and procedures. By tracking user actions, maintaining logs of activities, and having clear guidelines in place, accountability can be established within the system."
What is Malware?,"Malware is like a sneaky digital bug that infects your device without permission. It can cause all sorts of trouble, like stealing your information, messing up your files, or even taking control of your computer."
What are the different types of malwares?,"The different types of malware include viruses, worms, and keyloggers."
How can we protect our information?,"One way to protect our information is through cybersecurity measures. Cybersecurity involves practices and technologies designed to protect computers, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, and damage. This can include using strong passwords, keeping software up to date, being cautious of phishing attempts, using encryption, and implementing firewalls."
What is Social Engineering?,"Social engineering in cybersecurity is like a digital con game. Instead of using fancy hacking tools, cybercriminals use tricks and manipulation to deceive people into giving away sensitive information or doing something they shouldn't, like clicking on a harmful link or sharing their passwords. It's all about exploiting human trust rather than technical vulnerabilities. So social engineering method includes phishing, spear phishing, vishing, and smishing."
What is Phishing?,"Phishing is a type of fraud attempt where attackers try to manipulate people into giving important information, such as personal details or financial information, over phone calls or emails."
How can Phishing be identified?,"Phishing attempts can be identified by looking out for certain signs such as:

1. Suspicious sender email address or phone number.
2. Urgency or threats in the message.
3. Poor grammar or spelling errors in the message.
4. Requests for personal or financial information.
5. Unusual links or attachments in the message.
6. Requests for immediate action without proper verification.
7. Messages that seem too good to be true.

Being cautious and verifying the authenticity of the message or sender can help in identifying phishing attempts."
What is Smishing?,"Smishing is like phishing, but it happens through text messages on your phone instead of emails. Scammers send fake texts that look like they're from legitimate sources, like your bank or a delivery service. They try to trick you into clicking on links or giving away personal information, just like in email phishing. So, in simple terms, smishing is phishing through text messages."
What is spear phishing?,"Spear phishing is a targeted form of phishing where cybercriminals customize their attacks for specific individuals or organizations. Instead of casting a wide net, like traditional phishing, spear phishing involves researching and tailoring messages to trick a particular person or group into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or financial data."
What is Vishing?,"Vishing is a type of scam where cybercriminals use phone calls (voice + phishing = vishing) to trick people into giving away personal information or money. They might pretend to be from a bank, government agency, or tech support, and try to scare or manipulate you into revealing sensitive details like passwords or credit card numbers."
